# Project: Wheel of Life Tracker
# ===============================

# -------------------------------
# General Overview
# -------------------------------
# Build a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing "Wheel of Life" web app.
# Implemented entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend).
# Must run locally and deploy cleanly on GitHub Pages.

# -------------------------------
# Functional Requirements
# -------------------------------

1. Layout:
   - Split screen with two vertical panels (responsive):
     - Left panel: displays aggregated/average scores.
     - Right panel: allows adding a new entry interactively.
   - Both panels contain chart visualizations (wheel/pie style).

2. Categories:
   - Use 8 default life areas:
     Business / Career,
     Finances,
     Health,
     Family and Friends,
     Romance,
     Personal Development,
     Fun and Recreation,
     Contribution to Society.
   - Each segment has its own color.

3. Interactivity:
   - On right side, user selects levels (1–10) per category directly via interactive chart.
   - Allow adding a short note and auto-store current date.
   - Save button stores data locally (no server).
   - Update left chart to reflect new averages.

4. Data Storage:
   - Use browser localStorage to persist:
     - Scores per category
     - Date of entry
     - Optional note
   - Structure example:
     {
       "date": "2025-10-07",
       "scores": {
         "Career": 8,
         "Health": 6,
         ...
       },
       "note": "Feeling more balanced this week"
     }

5. Visualization:
   - Use Chart.js or D3.js to render:
     - Radar chart or polar area chart for both panels.
     - Mini pie charts in history modal.
   - Include animations and hover tooltips.

6. Entry History:
   - “View All Entries” button opens modal window.
   - Display all past entries with:
     - Mini wheel chart
     - Date and short note
   - Option to delete or edit entries.

7. Responsiveness:
   - Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and large screens.
   - On mobile, stack sections vertically.
   - Charts resize smoothly and remain touch-friendly.

8. User Interface / Experience:
   - Clean, minimal aesthetic (Figma/Notion/Linear-inspired).
   - Rounded corners, gradients, soft shadows.
   - Light & Dark mode toggle.
   - Animated transitions (GSAP or anime.js).
   - Toast or popup after successful save.
   - Clear Data button to reset localStorage.

9. Export/Import:
   - Optional feature: export all entries as JSON.
   - Optional feature: import JSON to restore saved data.
