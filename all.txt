### Notes

* **Interactive input**: Click any spoke on the right chart, drag outward to set 1–10. Touch supported.
* **Validation**: All categories must be ≥ 1 before saving.
* **Edit**: Use the modal’s *Edit* to load an entry back into the right panel.
* **Themes**: Light/Dark remembered between visits.
* **Offline**: `sw.js` caches assets after first load.
* **Charts**: Averages use **Radar**; history mini-previews use **Polar Area** to visually distinguish.
* **Compatibility**: No backend; safe for GitHub Pages.
